1 There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,
like the wideness of the sea;
there’s a kindness in God's justice,
which is more than liberty.

2 There is welcome for the sinner,
and more graces for the good!
There is mercy with the Savior;
there is healing in his blood.

3 For the love of God is broader
than the measure of our mind;
and the heart of the Eternal
is most wonderfully kind.

4 If our love were but more simple,
we should rest upon God's word;
and our lives would be illumined
by the presence of our Lord.
