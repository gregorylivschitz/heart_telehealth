1 How can we name a Love
that wakens heart and mind,
indwelling all we know
or think or do
or seek or find?
Within our daily world,
in every human face,
Love's echoes sound
and God is found,
hid in the commonplace.

2 If we awoke to life
built on a rock of care
that asked no great reward
but firm, assured,
was simply there,
we can, with parents' names,
describe, and thus adore,
Love unconfined,
a father kind,
a mother strong and sure.

3 When people share a task,
and strength and skills unite
in projects old or new,
to make or do
with shared delight,
our Friend and Partner's will
is better understood,
that all should share,
create, and care,
and know that life is good.

4 So in a hundred names,
each day we all can meet
a presence, sensed and shown
at work, at home,
or in the street.
Yet every name we see,
shines in a brighter sun:
In Christ alone
is Love full grown
and life and hope begun.
