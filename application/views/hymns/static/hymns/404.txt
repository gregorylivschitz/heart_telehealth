Refrain:
Every time I feel the spirit
moving in my heart, I will pray.
Yes, every time I feel the spirit
moving in my heart, I will pray.

1 Upon the mountain, my Lord spoke,
out his mouth came fire and smoke.
All around me looks so shine,
ask my Lord if all was mine. (Refrain)

2 Jordan river runs right cold,
chills the body, not the soul.
Ain't but one train on this track,
runs to heaven and right back. (Refrain)
